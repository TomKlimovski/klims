## An attempt to clone stax.io, but for GCP

> would like to see how far I can get with repl.it, chatgpt and copilot.

 - vercel
 - next.js
 - tailwind
 - radix_ui (maybe)

 ### stretch
  - use [brancher.ai](https://brancher.ai) to quiz AI on best practice for GCP architecture


## Exit strategy
 - Tie in with epicarc.io
 - Sell to Stax
 - Find investor (i did reach out to gatt in nov-22, but donuts.)
